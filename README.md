When working with data, it is often helpful to explore it visually first. This allows us to get a feel for the
data and identify patterns. There are a few different ways to do this, with the exact approach depending
on the type of data to be analyzed. The objective of this notebook is to demonstrate
the process of visually exploring a dataset by analyzing e-commerce data through exploratory analysis.
The dataset used is the "Online Retail Dataset" which can be found in the UCI Machine Learning
Repository.
